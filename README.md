# Professional README Generator 


## Description:

- Why build a Readme Generator?

    Creating readme files can be time consuming and a bit tidious. This application is a remedy to that exact problem. By answering a set of questions in the terminal you are given a beautiful and professional readme to insert into your project!

- What was the problem solved?

    The problem that I solved was creating the back end environment for the site. Using an express.js API and sequelize I was able to interact with a MySQL database and make the application functional.

- What did I learn?

    I gained a better understanding of Express.js and also using a database.
